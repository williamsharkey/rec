# rec
Audio recording for macOS terminal.

## macOS installation

1. If you don't have homebrew, paste this into a macOS Terminal prompt.

```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it. 

2. Add this tap then install rec:
```
brew tap williamsharkey/rec
brew install rec
```
Now you can type ```rec``` in a terminal to make audio recordings.
